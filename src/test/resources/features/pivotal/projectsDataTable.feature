Feature: Projects

  Background:
    Given I use the "pivotal" service and the "owner" account
    And I send a POST request to "/projects" with datatable
      | name             | Project created by cucumber |
      | week_start_day   | Tuesday                     |
      | new_account_name | New Account                 |
      | iteration_length | 2                           |
    And I save the response as "P"
    And I save the request endpoint for deleting

  Scenario Outline: PUT Project
    When I send a PUT request to "/projects/{P.id}" with datatable
      | name   | Project updated by cucumber |
      | public | <public>                    |
    Then I validate the response has status code 200
    And I validate the response contains "name" equals "Project updated by cucumber"
    And I validate the response contains "public" equals "<public>"
    Examples:
      | public |
      | true   |
      | false  |
